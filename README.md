# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is an attempt to create a CDK template that can be used with a Next.js app.

Note that ./lib/static-site.ts is heavily based on https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/blob/master/typescript/static-site/index.ts.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
